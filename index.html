            It may be unfair,but what happens in a few days,sometimes even a single day,can change the course of a whole
            lifetime.

            With me as the glaring exception, my father molded the world around him to his liking. The problem, of
            course, was that Baba saw the world in black and white. And he got to decide what was black and what was
            white. You can't love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little.
            <br>

            I think that everything he did, feeding the poor, giving money to friends in need, it was all a way of
            redeeming himself. And that, I believe, is what true redemption is, Amir jan, when guilt leads to good.

            One time, when I was really little, I climbed a tree and ate these green, sour apples. My stomach swelled
            and became hard like a drum, it hurt a lot. Mother said that if I'd just waited for the apples to ripen, I
            wouldn't have become sick. So now, whenever I really want something, I try to remember what she said about
            the apples.

            There is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft....When you kill
            a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you
            tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness.

            If America taught me anything, it's that quitting is right up there with pissing in the Girl Scouts'
            lemonade jar.
            <br><br>
            I ran. A grown man running with a swarm of screaming children. But I didn't care. I ran with the wind
            blowing in my face, and a smile as wide as the valley of Panache on my lips. I ran.
